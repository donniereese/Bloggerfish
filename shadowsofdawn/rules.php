<h3>Account Creation and Management:</h3>
<blockquote>
Any registered user is allowed only one account for either of the two servers 
hosted by <b>Dark Abyss</b>.  No one may be allowed an account on each server 
or two accounts on the same server except if specifically allowed by an 
Administrator of <b>Dark Abyss</b>.  Although there are differences in the primary 
RPG servers, the game play is relatively the same.  Any failure to follow this 
rule will mean the immediate deletion / removal of all of your accounts.
<br><br>
We highly stress for any user to not share an account.  The account of any user 
is not to be traded, shared, or managed by any other user except the member who 
registered the account.  A users account has their own personal information and 
should not be viewed by any other person.
</blockquote>
<h3>Contact Information:</h3>
<blockquote>
All information that you provide on signing up for any service provided by <b>Dark Abyss</b> 
or requested from <b>Dark Abyss</b> at any time is only for the protection of fraud 
by any users at any time and to provide us with accurate information about you so
that we may provide better services for the user.
<br><br>
All information needs to be accurate and complete for any service provided by 
<b>Dark Abyss</b> so that we may use this when we need it.  If not, a user or 
person may lose their account or lose out on anything important or advantageous 
to the user.
<br><br>
Any e-mail address submitted by a user needs to be accurate and up to date so 
that we may get in contact with the users in case we may ever find a need to. 
This is only to provide you with vital information and updates about your account 
or other services you are connected to.  Your e-mail address will not be given 
out to ad companies or services and will be kept private and confidential. 
</blockquote>
<h3>Game Play:</h3>
<blockquote>
Under no circumstances is a user allowed to use the aid of automated processes 
to improve their performance or status in any game managed by <b>Dark Abyss</b>. Use of automated scripts or 
other software that accesses the Utopia servers for any reason outside of normal 
game play is expressly forbidden. 
</blockquote>
<h3>Code of Honor:</h3>
<blockquote>
We do not expect any user to be perfect in our game.  We do ask that you maintain 
some sense of dignity while on any of our servers or other services.  We ask that 
you keep any language to a minimum at least.  We also ask that you do not attempt 
to manipulate bugs in our system or commit any act of fraud in our servers.  This 
will result in the deletion or restriction of any member's account that does so.
</blockquote>
<h3>Attitudes and Languages:</h3>
<blockquote>
All games hosted by <b>Dark Abyss</b> are for all ages and group of people unless 
specified clearly.  You are to treat others with respect and courtesy while on 
any of out services.  Any violation will be dealt with by the deletion or restriction 
of the violators account immediately.
</blockquote>
<h3>Violation:</h3>
<blockquote>
Please do not attempt to persuade any other user or possible user to break any 
rules or policies specified in any form of manual or rule listing provided by 
<b>Dark Abyss</b>.  Anyone attempting to do this will have their account deleted 
or restricted</b>
</blockquote>

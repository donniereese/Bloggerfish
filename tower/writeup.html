
Control Panel
------------------------------------
Hub:
  The hub is the standard view of a user's control panel.  This goes for 
  basic users, paid users, moderators, and even administrators.  In this 
  view, you have a set of panes that are viewable, and update using ajax 
  methods, or an alternate view for people with lower-end browsers or 
  those who choose to turn it off due to bandwith problems, or other 
  reasons.
  
  Each of these panes represent a different aspect of tools, statistics 
  or other applets collected on the website.  Different users might have 
  different access levels to the tools, or even set a list with customizable 
  reference code, using it to set statistics in a list format, but each 
  user can customize what they can or cant see in this pane, and how many 
  columns they see them in.  They will be movable, resizable, and collapsable 
  dynamically with DOM scripting.
  
  Some of these tools are a quick view of a sub-page on the control panel, 
  such as the Blog Organizational tool, which allows users to manage multiple 
  blogs under the same account, and the ones that are shared between users.  
  Another example would be a tool that monitors, hits, users activly visiting, 
  and other statistics that might be important to any level of user.
